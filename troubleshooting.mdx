# Troubleshooting

## No channels are showing up on the dashboard

If you don't see any channels on the dashboard, it's likely because the bot doesn't have the permissions to see them. If the channels are hidden behind a role, give it to the bot.

The bot requires all permissions to work as intended. If you changed them when inviting the bot, reinvite it again with full permissions enabled.

## My server's threads aren't showing up on Google

If you see threads on Velumn but not on Google, don't worry—this is normal. We let Google know about the threads using a sitemap and follow best SEO practices, but we have no control over what Google indexes.

Google crawls and indexes content on its own schedule, which can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. If it's been over a month and your content still hasn't appeared in search results, contact our support team.

## Formatting looks wrong in forum posts

We are slowly expanding our support and plan to match every Discord feature, you can check the progress here. Something passed our checks? We will fix it immediately.

## Messages are missing or partially indexed

The bot is built to resume from where it left off and retries on failed messages, so missing messages should be very rare. But in case of an edge case, please let us know.

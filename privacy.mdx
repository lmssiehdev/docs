## What We Don't Collect
- Discord avatars
- Discord usernames 

## What Gets Synced
- **Your display name** (the nickname shown in that server)
- **Message content** from threads the server admin has enabled
- **Only threads** - regular channels, DMs, and private channels are never synced

## You have full control over your content
Use the `/manage-account` command in any server with Velumn:

- **Anonymize**: Replaces your display name with a randomly generated name on all past and future forum posts
- **Delete All**: Permanently removes all your synced messages from all forums and prevents future syncing
- **Restore**: (Coming soon) Re-enable message syncing after using Delete All

If you delete a message in Discord, it's automatically removed from the forum.
